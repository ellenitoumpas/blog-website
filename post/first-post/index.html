  <p>So this is the first post on my new Data portfolio. Phew what a journey! This blog has spent over eight months on my to do list. But now it is alive!</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s try and recap everything so far. Why am I here? How did I get here? And where to from here?</p>

<p>Well I am Elleni. I am, and for the past 10 years have been a photographer. I run my own business/businesses here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ellenitoumpas.com.au">Elleni Toumpas Weddings</a> | <a href="http://www.ellenitoumpasphotography.com">Elleni Toumpas Corporate Photography</a></p>

<p>But Elleni, why are you now starting a Data related website? Well since February 2018 I have been studying a Masters of Data Analytics at RMIT, with the hope to eventually convert that degree into a new career working with data. I temporarily toyed with the idea of calling this blog &ldquo;From MB to bytes&rdquo;&hellip;but I didn&rsquo;t. That is a lame name, but yes I guess that is my journey.</p>

<p>I am in my (late) 30s and getting ready for a career transition, trying to learn as much as I can, but at the same time I am trying to figure out in what direction I want to head in this industry.</p>

<p>For the last part of my career I have always focussed on what the heart said. I was also drawn to &lsquo;passion&rsquo; based careers, and I feel this is going to be a part of my personality that I can not ignore with delving into this new world too.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say for certain but this blog will probably explore a few different things. It will showcase new skills learnt, not only in my course but as I play in my own time. It will also be a way for me to collate stories and things that inspire me from across the data world. Over time I am hoping this might help create a certain direction in my new career.</p>

<p>Stayed tuned. There will be much to come!</p>
